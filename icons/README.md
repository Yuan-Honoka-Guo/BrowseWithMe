# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing tool. For a quick start, you can:
1. Use an online icon generator like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Create simple colored squares with text using any image editor
3. Use Chrome's default icon as a placeholder during development

The icons represent the "Browse With Me" extension and should ideally include:
- A friendly/copilot-themed design
- Blue color scheme to match the extension UI (#1a73e8)
- Simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
